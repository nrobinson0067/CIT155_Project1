			<h3>Health and Safety</h3>
			<p>Many jobs require up to date lifesaving skills because they address health emergencies every 
			day – people such as health care providers, first responders, and lifeguards. Others, including 
			teachers and babysitters, are entrusted with precious young lives that could require aid
			on a moment’s notice.</p>
			<p>Those of us who don’t face health emergencies every day can also benefit from Red Cross 
			training. With a wide array of Lifeguarding, Caregiving and Babysitting, and Swimming and Water 
			Safety courses the Red Cross can provide you with the training and skills you need to prevent, prepare 
			for and respond to emergencies.</p>
