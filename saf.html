			<p>Due to recent re-organizations, International Services falls under Service to the Armed 
			Forces.  </p>
			<h3>SAF</h3>
			<p>Since Clara Barton helped soldiers in the civil war, the American Red Cross has deployed 
			all over the world with service-members.  The basic functions is the Emergency Communications Message.  In addition, volunteer opportunities, 
				disaster relief, and Health and Safety classes.  To learn more, please contact your local SAF office, 
				located on most military bases. </p>
			<h3>International Services</h3>
			<p>The international services division works with Red Cross societies around the globe.  Their function, like 
				all of the Red Cross, is to alleviate human suffering, but their mandate extends past the US borders.
				Their assistance is to coordinate with both the International Federation of the Red Cross and the 
				International Committee of the Red Cross, the neutral third party that is the guardian of the Geneva 
				Conventions. </p>

			<p>The Red Cross helps military members, veterans and their families prepare for,
			cope with, and respond to the challenges of military service. Emergency communications,
			training, support to wounded warriors and veterans, and access to community resources help 
			an average of 150,000 military families and veterans annually.</p>
			<p>Emergency communications messages are a third party verification and notification in case of 
			emergency.  From a civilian point of view, this seems odd. But servicemember's cannot leave
			even in case of emergency.  Instead, the Red Cross verifies the emergency and passes that information 
			to the servicemember's chain of command in order to help the command decide if the servicemember can go 
			on emergency leave.  This also includes the notification process.  In a day of cellphones and constant 
			communications, servicemember's can still be out of contact for sometimes extended amounts of time. 
			There is a Red Cross channel to pass information about emergencies through that channel.  </p>
			
			
			<h2><a name="IS">International Services</a></h2>
			<p>Due to recent reorganization, International Services now falls under Services to the Armed Forces. 
			The American Red Cross is part of the worldâ€™s largest humanitarian
			network with 13 million volunteers in 187 countries. Working together, we help respond 
			to disasters, build safer communities, and teach the rules of war. Each year, we reach an 
			average of more than 100 million people across the globe.</p>
			<p>The international Red Cross and Red Crescent network is the largest humanitarian network in the world 
			with a presence and activities in almost every country.  All Red Cross and Red Crescent activities have
			one central purpose: to help those who suffer, without discrimination, whether during conflict, in response
			to natural or man-made disasters, or due to conditions of chronic poverty.  There are three parts of the 
			global Red Cross network. Each has its own individual status and exercises no authority over the others.  
			The three parts are: the National Societies, the International Federation, and the International Committee 
			(ICRC).  The National Societies operate differently in each country, but have the overall goal of 
			alleviating human suffering.  The International Federation is the coalition that operates in peacetime.
			The ICRC is the governing body during war.  More can be learned at <a href="http://icrc.org">their website</a>.
