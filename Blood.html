			<h3>Blood Services</h3>
			<p>Our blood donors are ordinary people – high school students, factory and office workers, 
			business executives, parents and grandparents, and people from every walk of life. But they share 
			one thing – a generous spirit, a desire to give back to their community and help others. Blood donors
			play an integral role in the delivery of modern healthcare. Many lifesaving medical treatments and
			procedures involve blood transfusions and would not be possible without a safe and reliable blood supply.</p>
			<p>The Red Cross is also a leader in research and testing to protect the safety of the blood supply.
			We were among the first to develop and implement testing for many infectious diseases including, HIV, 
			hepatitis B and C viruses, West Nile virus, and more recently the agent of Chagas disease.</p>
			<p>If you already donate blood, thank you! You are making a lifesaving contribution that benefits 
			accident victims, cancer patients, surgical candidates, children with blood disorders and many others. 
			If you have never donated blood, please consider doing so. Your donations are always in constant demand.</p>
