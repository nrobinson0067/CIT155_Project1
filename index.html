			<p>Since Clara Barton earned the nickname the Angel of the Battlefield in the Civil War,
			the American Red Cross has been working to alleviate human suffering. </p>
			<p>The Red Cross works in several different ways to reach our mission. Please explore to learn
			more about the ways that we work do to this.  </p>
			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>Since our founding by Clara Barton on May 21, 1881, the American Red Cross has been dedicated to
			serving people in need. We received our first congressional charter in 1900 and to this day we are 
			tasked by the federal government with providing services to members of the American armed forces and 
			their families as well as providing disaster relief in the United States and around the world.</p>
			<p>Even while the Red Cross adapts to meet the changing needs of the people we serve, we always stay
			true to those roots. Are you familiar with the classic images of Red Cross nurses helping American 
			soldiers and civilian war victims during World War I? In fact, as you read this Red Cross staff and 
			volunteers are still deploying alongside America’s military. Maybe you’ve taken a class through the 
			Red Cross, such as first aid certification or how to swim. Did you know we’ve been offering similar 
			training since the early 1900s? Have you ever given blood or received donated blood? The Red Cross 
			developed the first nationwide civilian blood program in the 1940s and we still provide more than 40%
			of the blood products in this country.</p>
			<p>Today, as throughout our long history, the Red Cross depends on generous contributions of time,
			blood, and money from the American public to support our lifesaving services and programs. We invite
			you to learn about our history and hope you will feel inspired to become more involved with the Red Cross.</p>
